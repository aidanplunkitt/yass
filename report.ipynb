    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boolean satisfiability problem, often abbreviated as SAT, is the problem of determining if there is at least one solution to a given Boolean formula. A solution is some assignment of Boolean variables (either True or False) that results in the formula evaluating to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAT is significant because it was the first problem proven to be NP-complete, meaning solutions may only be found via some brute force search algorithm (exponential time complexity) but valid solutions can be quickly verified (polynomial time complexity). Other problems can be shown to be NP-complete if they can be mathematically reduced to the SAT problem. Thus, algorithms to quickly and efficiently find solutions to a boolean formula (aptly named SAT solvers) are useful across a wide range of optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any Boolean formula may be converted into a logically equivalent formula that is in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). An example of a formula in CNF is `(A OR B) AND (C OR D OR E) AND (F)`. Each letter is a `literal`, each disjunction (OR) of literals is known as a `clause`, and the entire formula is a conjunction (AND) of such clauses. Nearly every existing SAT solver and automated theorem prover assumes the input to be in CNF form, as does this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive brute-force algorithm can determine whether a given formula is satisfiable; simply test every combination of True/False for the entire set of variables in the formula. A pure brute-force can be improved upon by utilizing \"backtracking\", where part of a solution space is no longer explored once it is shown to be unsatisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode of a backtracking search algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "backtrack(formula):\n",
    "    for each variable v_i in the formula:\n",
    "        if v_i has not yet been assigned a value:\n",
    "            v_i = True\n",
    "            check_sat(formula)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            if not UNSAT:\n",
    "                result = backtrack(formula)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            v_i = False\n",
    "            check_sat(formula)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            if not UNSAT:\n",
    "                result = backtrack(formula)\n",
    "                \n",
    "    return result \n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm (DPLL) is a backtracking-based search algorithm that adds two further enhancements to avoid large sections of the naive search space. \n",
    "* Unit propogation looks for clauses with a single literal. Since every clause must be SAT for the formula to be SAT, then by extension the literal of a unit clause must be SAT for the formula to be SAT. Thus, the variable associated with that literal can be assigned a value (True/False) and the unit clause can be discarded.\n",
    "* Pure literal elimination looks for variables that only have a single polarity (either True or False) in every instance in the formula, which are known as pure. These pure literals can always be made true, so they may be discarded from the search space."

    "SAT, like all NP problems, has a theoretically exponential time complexity. As commented in the code of the `backtrack` function, the implementation of this algorithm has a recurrence relation of `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + p`. This can be visualized as a binary tree of height n, thus there are 2<sup>n</sup> nodes and the algorithm is O(2<sup>n</sup>). However, like dynamic programming, SAT solvers aim to reduce the size of the solution space that actually needs to be checked. Additionally, in practice SAT solvers may employ heuristics that make certain assumptions about the input data. This can significantly speed up common cases to quickly solve otherwise intractable problems with exponentially asymptotic runtimes."

    "While NP problems are the bane of computer scientists, there are clever heuristics that can be used to significantly narrow the actual amount of computation that needs to be done. In this case, the simple additions of unit propogation and backtracking to a brute force search algorithm provide a substantial realized runtime speedup. The difference is several orders of magnitude despite the theoretical complexity of the algorithm not changing. Further improvements could be made as well, including an implementation of pure literal elimination as well as \"hot-loop\" optimization of the code that is executed between each recurrence."
